                >The Alaska Department of Revenue - Tax Division is responsible for collecting state taxes and
                administering tax laws, as well as regulating charitable gaming and providing revenue estimating and
                economic forecasting. The current website provides online services, tax forms, reports and answers to
                common questions for Alaska taxpayers. However, the website has some limitations and challenges that need
                to be addressed</span

                    The goal of this project was to redesign the website to improve its usability, accessibility,

                    the user experience by simplifying the navigation, layout, and content of the website.<br />Improve
                    the user satisfaction by creating a responsive, modern, and consistent design that reflects the
                    states identity and values.

                  After analyzing the existing site and the user needs, I sketched some wireframes for the new site layout
                  and navigation. I then used a tool called Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes that added more
                  details and interactivity to the wireframes. I used the Alaska state colors, fonts, and logos to make
                  the prototypes consistent with the brand identity. I also followed the web design and accessibility
                  guidelines to make the prototypes user-friendly and inclusive. I tested the prototypes with some
                  potential users and collected their feedback. I used the feedback to iterate on the design and improve
                  the user experience.

                  In this case study, I presented the process and the outcomes of the redesign project for the Alaska
                  Department of Revenue Tax Division site. The project aimed to improve the site’s functionality, design,
                  and usability, and to meet the needs and goals of the site users and stakeholders. I followed a
                  user-centered design approach that involved research, analysis, prototyping, testing, development, and
                  launch. I used various tools and methods to create and validate the design solutions. I also documented
                  the challenges, learnings, and achievements along the way. The project was successful in delivering a
                  new site that was more user-friendly, accessible, and consistent with the brand identity. The new site
                  also performed well in terms of the key performance indicators and user satisfaction.
